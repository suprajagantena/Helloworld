The concepts of node, stage and step are different:

node specifies where something shall happen. You give a name or a label, and Jenkins runs the block there.

stage structures your script into a high-level sequence. Stages show up as columns in the Pipeline Stage view with average stage times and colours for the stage result.

step is one way to specify what shall happen. sh is of a similar quality, it is a different kind of action. (You can also use build for things that are already specified as projects.)

So steps can reside within nodes, (if they don't, they are executed on the master), and nodes and steps can be structured into an overall sequence with stages.
